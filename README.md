# üìπ WebRTC Video Calling App

This is a real-time peer-to-peer video calling application developed using **WebRTC**, **Socket.IO**, and **Node.js**. It allows users to join a video call room and communicate via high-quality video and audio using a unique room ID. The app is divided into two parts: a **client** and a **server**, both of which must be run separately.
